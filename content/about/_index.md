Cross Process Design House started in South Lake Tahoe, CA, moved to Lunenburg, MA for a while, moved back to Tahoe, scooted down to Somerset, CA, then over to El Dorado Hills, up to Colfax, then jumped to the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Today's home base is the Big Island of Hawai'i, where imagery floats in the air and ideas grow like ferns on the lava.
