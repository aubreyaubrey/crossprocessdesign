This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator, utilizes the Reveal-Hugo theme (customized!) and is hosted on Netlify. Anymore all my personal sites are built with Hugo. It really is the fastest – and most fun – way to build websites.

Whenever I make a new drawing, I photograph it, transfer the files to my computer and size them in photoshop, add a new markdown file and push the changes to a git repository. Netlify pulls the updated version from git automatically and the new drawings are live.
