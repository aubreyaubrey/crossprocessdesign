description: There is learning and then there is more learning.

Does art imitate life or does life imitate art? I sure as hell can't tell. Two years ago I made a drawing of a house on an island. Today an inspector showed up at 9:00 am to take a tour. 

The house is blue, has two staircases and eleven ethernet ports. No wifi I said. No wifi! I prefer cables. And so there is no wifi and there are cables.

Next is breathing, stretching, being, and in between, making. There are picture frames to assemble, bookshelves to construct, mushroom jerky to dry and scrolls of white paper to paint. There are places to go and people to see. There is red tape to forget and room to forge ahead. In spite of elections and lockdowns!

What's next is in the making.
