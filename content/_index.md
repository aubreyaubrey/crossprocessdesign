## All Part of The Process

Every design project is unique but the process is often the same. I've worked in lots of different spaces with lots of different teams on lots of different projects. I've discovered the unifying aspect to successful (dare I say, enjoyable) projects is a well-defined procedure! Defined stages and steps create a structure where creativity can flourish. This is how you get from concept to creation and it's my specialty.
