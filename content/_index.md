The goals of my design practice are simple: to integrate imagination and workflow, transform ideas into finished products and build great relationships along the way.

### --- PROCESS ---

Every design project is unique but the process is often the same. Over the last fifteen years, working in various design and marketing roles, I've discovered the common aspect among successful projects is not just a great team, inspired content or well-executed visuals. While all of those elements contribute, the foundation must be a coherent procedure to serve as a roadmap.

### --- BRANDING ---

Branding is about telling a story and establishing a link between a company and its customers. Visual cues help audiences understand what a particular company does and what differentiates them in the marketplace. My goal with branding projects is to create a visual language that will capture the essence of a product line or service offering and convey that as simply as possible, establishing a style of communication that gains more recognition and value over time.

### --- WEB DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT ---

With a background in user interface design, front-end development and content marketing, I have a unique perspective when it comes to the wide world of web design. I can appreciate the inherent value of creating a beautiful, navigable collection of pages, but I also understand the necessity of getting those pages ranking on search engines and generating leads. These days a comprehensive content marketing strategy is just as foundational as a site map, user flows and page designs. 

### --- PRINT ---

Effective marketing makes use of a variety of different mediums. Unlike websites, which continually evolve, printed pieces must endure to retain value so they need to be even more carefully designed and delivered. From business cards and sales collateral to manuals and books to packaging lines and tradeshow displays, there isn't much in the world of print I haven't done.
