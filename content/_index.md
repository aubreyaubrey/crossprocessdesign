## All Part of The Process

Every design project is unique but the process is often the same. Over the last fifteen years, working in various design and marketing roles, I've discovered the common aspect among successful projects is not just a great team, inspired content or well-executed visuals. While all of those elements contribute, the foundation must be a coherent procedure to serve as a roadmap. Defined stages and steps create the structure where creativity can flourish. This is how you get from concept to creation and it's my specialty.
