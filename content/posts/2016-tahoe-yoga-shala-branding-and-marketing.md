The finished logo for Tahoe Yoga Shala features a tree with branches stretched upward toward the sky and roots firmly planted in the Earth. Balance is important in the logo, as it is in the practice of yoga. The graphic was born from a desire to express the idea of opposite movements that complement each other while resisting each other. In the middle of the tree the still point is held in place by these opposing forces.

I started out sketching all different types of trees. As the focus narrowed to roots and branches that would mirror each other I started drawing more abstract versions that were more like patterns than realistic branches. 

Once my client chose a direction she liked best, I developed the style more, scanned a few images and started creating digital versions.

With the branch, root and trunk styles determined, I started combining the elements into a simplified mark, adding colors and fonts.

From this stage we experimented with more fonts and colors. My client ended up choosing earth tones and a simple sans serif font with thin lines similar to the tree branches.

One of my favorite parts of design is taking one idea and expanding on it to create a series of related ideas. The central component could be a logo, a color palette or even a shape. A balance between repetition and variety allows brands to evolve while staying recognizable. 

In developing marketing materials and advertisements for Tahoe Yoga Shala, we let the logo play a central role but experimented with different fonts and colors. Over a few years the logo itself evolved to stay in tune with where the style of the brand was going. The simplified version I created originally as a sticker design became the logo we used most often across new materials.
