### Branding
Branding is about telling a story and establishing a link between a company and its customers. Visual cues help audiences understand what a particular company does and what differentiates them in the marketplace. My goal with branding projects is to create a visual language that will capture the essence of a product line or service offering and convey that as simply as possible, establishing a style of communication that gains more recognition and value over time.

### Web Design
With a background in user interface design, front-end development and content marketing, I have a unique perspective when it comes to the wide world of web design. I can appreciate the inherent value of creating a beautiful, navigable collection of pages, but I also understand the necessity of getting those pages ranking on search engines and generating leads. These days a comprehensive content marketing strategy is just as foundational as a site map, user flows and page designs.

### Print Design
Effective marketing makes use of a variety of different mediums. Unlike websites, which continually evolve, printed pieces must endure to retain value so they need to be even more carefully designed and delivered. From business cards and sales collateral to manuals and books to packaging lines and trade show displays, there isn't much in the world of print I haven't done. 

### Marketing
Not just mailers and product brochures, “marketing” encompasses all the processes a company undertakes to get people interested in their products. From websites and SEO to how many times the phone rings before someone answers, every time a potential customer interacts with a business, their impression is being formed. Spreading awareness involves analyzing current efforts and developing new strategies while monitoring what is actually driving traffic and leads.

### Content Strategy
In the world of organic search, content is king (at least for now). My approach to content development is focused on education, writing that sounds like it was written by a living person, and organization that makes sense to people and search engines alike. Many companies possess incredible in-depth knowledge about their unique offering but that expertise doesn’t always come through on their website. Content development is one of the best ways to show authority, establish a connection with potential customers and of course, gain higher search rankings.

### Project Management
Every design project is unique but the process is often the same. Over the last fifteen years, working in various design and marketing roles, I've discovered the common aspect among successful projects is not just a great team, inspired content or well-executed visuals. The foundation must be a coherent procedure to serve as a roadmap and consistent communication to stay on track.

### Process
Although I cross disciplines, process and procedure are my foundations. I like to gather as much information as possible at the beginning of a project then create a list of deliverables and estimate a timeline. Priorities sometimes shift along the way but with a guide in place it’s easy to stay on track even with changes. I use detailed spreadsheets to log activity, and measure progress so I always know where things stand and can easily report to stakeholders.
