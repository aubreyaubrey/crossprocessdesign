I'm Aubrey, a seasoned visual designer, specializing in user-centric interfaces, with experience in development, marketing, and project management. I bring an artistic approach to visual communication and strive to create unique, flowing experiences on and off the screen.

I specialize in branding, web design, print design, marketing, content development and project management. 

Over the past fifteen years I have transformed an innate love for aesthetics into a unique approach to design and marketing that is focused on beauty and utility. I believe that good design makes life better, whether it comes in the form of a house, a city or a website. I strive for simplicity and balance in my work and above all aim to meet the needs of my clients. I would love to discuss your next project and see what creative solutions we can come up with!

Outside of work you can find me on the trails in South Lake Tahoe, soaking up the good vibrations. Iâ€™m an avid yogi and practice daily meditation. I love to laugh, cook, eat, paint, draw, sit in the sun, hug the trees, walk slow, run fast, travel, stay put, and feel it all.
