      <description>With over 500 portraits of PCT hikers to showcase, the objective with this book was to make the design disappear. We wanted to create a presentation format that was consistent enough to direct all the focus toward the portraits, but varied enough to keep the reader&amp;rsquo;s interest.</description>

      <title>YAKULT [ Marketing Site Built with Parallax Scrolling ]</title>
      <link>https://crossprocessdesign.com/work/1007-yakult-marketing-site/</link>

      <guid>https://crossprocessdesign.com/work/1007-yakult-marketing-site/</guid>
      <description>This temporary marketing site was built as a companion to a 2014 television advertising campaign for Yakult. I designed mock-ups that would complement the styling of the commercials and used jquery to create parallax scrolling, clouds that moved on and off the screen and cherry blossoms that floated down in the background continuously. This site served as a placeholder on yakultusa.com while the company rebuilt their main website.</description>
